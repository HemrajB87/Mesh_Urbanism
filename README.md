## How to run the product

_This section needs to be edited to reflect how the user can interact with thefeature released in your project_

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes one single argument (so far), the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
cd generator 

To Run generator in Default mode:
java -jar generator.jar test1.mesh

To open HELP mode to display what arguments can be entered, add -h:
java -jar generator.jar test1.mesh -h

To run generator in Custom User Configuration mode (replace square bracket values with user values):
java -jar generator.jar test1.mesh [grid/irregular] [#_polygons] [relaxation_level]

Example: 
java -jar generator.jar test1.mesh grid 200 100
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
cd visualizer 
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/test1.mesh test1.svg

To run the visualizer in Debug mode add -X: java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/test1.mesh test1.svg -X

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.


## Part 2: Scenario
To demonstrate "Part 2" user can run the project as instructed. If user includes "-X" when running visualizer code to generate mesh, 
the mesh will be generated in which the polygons(and associated segments and vertices) are displayed in black, centroids in red, and neighbourhood
relationships in light grey. If the "-X" is not present then the colors and thickness will be randomized. 


## Backlog

### Definition of Done

A feature is considered done if it is supported in both the generator and visualizer. In other words if we can generate and visualize what we generated.
